# Energy-Harvester

This is my bachelor thesis about electromagnetic energy harvester.

Vibration energy exists in wide aspects of life. The intelligent materials and structural components can recycle and utilize some waste vibration energy. 
Vibrational energy harvesters are considered as independent power sources that are expected to **be used in low-power electronic devices**, 
such as wireless sensors, portable devices and medical implants. Unlike the most commonly used chemical batteries, the energy input of the energy 
harvesters come from the surrounding environment. Therefore, through the research and application of energy harvesters, a series of problems brought by 
batteries can be effectively reduced, such as limited life or the size problems of the batteries, environmental pollution problems and maintenance and 
replacement problems. At the same time, with the development of low-power integrated circuits and high-efficiency energy storage, energy harvesting 
technology will promote the development of medical, automotive and environmental fields.

This paper presents a **wearable electromagnetic energy harvester (WEEH)**. The WEEH adopts a tumbler-type structure and is internally provided with an 
electromagnet and coils. The proposed WEEH is intended to be hung on a back-bag or other parts of the body as a hanging ornament. When people walk or run, 
vibration energy will be generated to output electric energy through electromagnetic induction.
